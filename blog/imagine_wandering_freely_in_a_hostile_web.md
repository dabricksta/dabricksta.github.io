Imagine feeling comfortable putting out your innermost thoughts and opinions, information that no one has ever asked of you - certainly not all of it - directly online, where it can be Hoover-ed up by archivers, web scrapers, search engines, advertisers, large language models, and AI. Like being a tiny little 1/1 creature token stepping lightly into a mono-green landfall spider's web.
