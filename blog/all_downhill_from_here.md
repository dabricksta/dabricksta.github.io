# It's all downhill from here.

## 2025-06-15

I'm a data engineer with a passion for building and maintaining data pipelines. I'm currently working at a small private adtech company, where I'm responsible for building and maintaining data pipelines for internal partners and external clients. I'm also a big fan of dark humor and sardonicism and I'm always looking for new ways to contribute to our collective venomous riptear of ennui.
